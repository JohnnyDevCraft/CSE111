## I choose to implement a tire volume calculator as a simple application that
# uses some additional libraries to enhance the user experience.  When running
# this code, make sure you have the required libraries installed:
# First, rename the requirements file `req.txt.py` to `req.txt` and then run:
# pip install -r req.txt
## The application requires python 3.10 or higher.
from App import App

app = App("Tire Volume Calculator")
app.Run()
